Our goal with this project was to improve the flight experience of First Person View (FPV) drones. This was achieved by redefining how an FPV drone is controlled by introducing motion control and by designing the UI specifically for FPV.

This project has been challenging and incredibly rewarding. It involved designing multiple prototypes, designing and testing software, electronics and mechanical systems. We manufactured and assembled more than hundreds of prototypes that are still used by our beta-testers to this day.
