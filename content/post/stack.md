Stack is a shelving system that consists of a combination of slotted boards of wood and threaded rods.

By selecting the board dimensions, the number of boards, the number of supporting rods and the threaded rod height, the user can design a shelf specific to his needs.

For lower shelves, the slots can be replaced with holes. This makes the assembly process more tedious as the nuts have to be threaded all the way. But it does provide a cleaner look.
