The concept for drops came while thinking of building a version of Photon (my other pendant lamp) that would be modular. Here is the result:

Each "droplet" consists of a module that supports an LED. Similarly to Photon, the light can shine directly onto the surface but is also reflected to the ceiling by the reflector beneath the LED. Here is what a module looks like:

The aluminum block that holds the LED also serves as a heat sink. Heat is transferred to the fins and to the reflector.

The LEDs used come from Cree with a CRI of 90+ at 2700k. That is some of the best stuff I could find and they look great.

Just for fun, here is an early prototype of a droplet module:
